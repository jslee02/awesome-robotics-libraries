  ⚠️  STOP — Are you editing README.md directly?
  README.md is auto-generated from data/*.yaml files.
  PRs that only modify README.md will be rejected by CI.

  👉 To suggest a NEW resource, use the issue template instead:
     https://github.com/jslee02/awesome-robotics-libraries/issues/new?template=suggest-resource.yml

  👉 To fix an existing entry, edit the relevant data/*.yaml file.

  See CONTRIBUTING.md for details.
